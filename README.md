# Personal Portfolio - Three.js + Vite + Tailwind CSS

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website is built using **Three.js** for 3D rendering, **Vite** for fast development
and bundling, and **Tailwind CSS** for a modern styling approach. I wanted this project to be a representation of me 
and what I enjoy. Using these frameworks, sources like SketchFab and tools like Blender has been great to expand my knowledge
in web development and I will continue to update this to be accurate.

## Features:

* 3D Scenes: Built with Three.js, featuring interactive 3D models and animations, custom animations for assets like the fireplace.
* Simple poly Design: Fully responsive layout using Tailwind CSS, ensuring this portfolio looks great on every device.
* Accessible links and ways to reach out. Utilizing tools like Email.JS makes it easy to reach out to me and even give feedback.
